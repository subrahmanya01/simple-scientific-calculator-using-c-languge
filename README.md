# Scientific-calculator-using-c-languge
## what are the operation performed?
    This calculator will perform arithmatic operations (Addition,Substraction,Multiplication,Division) along with some trignometric functions sin,cos,tan and some other functions like squire root,log,power,exponential.
## What is the input format?
     it will ask for entering the expression. we can input the expression using brackets also for example we can give input like (20+40) or 20+40 also.
    
    ENTER THE EXPRESSION
    20+40
    
    after entering the expression it will show like this
    
    ENTER THE EXPRESSION
    20+40
    CURRENT MODES
    ---------------------------
    |0|FIX   |1|RAD(1)/DEGREE(0)
    ---------------------------
    SELECT MODE
    1->FIX
    2->RAD
    3->DEGREE
    4->EVALUVATE
    
    Now we have to select among 4 option
    1.if we want to fix the digits of decimals in output.
       if we select 1 than it will ask for 
       ENTER THE EXPRESSION
        20+40
        CURRENT MODES
        ---------------------------
        |0|FIX   |1|RAD(1)/DEGREE(0)
        ---------------------------
        SELECT MODE
        1->FIX
        2->RAD
        3->DEGREE
        4->EVALUVATE
        1
        ENTER THE NUMBER OF DECIMALS 0-6
        
    we have to enter the required fix in the range of 0-6
    for example fixing for 4 digit than
        ENTER THE EXPRESSION
        20+40
        CURRENT MODES
        ---------------------------
        |0|FIX   |1|RAD(1)/DEGREE(0)
        ---------------------------
        SELECT MODE
        1->FIX
        2->RAD
        3->DEGREE
        4->EVALUVATE
        1
        ENTER THE NUMBER OF DECIMALS 0-6
        4
       After entering the fix mode is activated for 4 digits.
    
    2.if we want to evaluvate the expression in radian mode.
       initially calculator is in rad mode.
    3.if we want to evaluvate the expression in degree mode.
    4.for evaluvating the expression.
